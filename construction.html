            "Horn encouraged attendees to be bold rather than afraid or tentative, and she emphasized planning and persistence. She also advised taking advantage of the many resources Duke offers: everything from creating a “personal board of advisors” comprised of faculty and staff who’ll go to bat for you, to enrolling in skill-building workshops, to finding cofounders and teammates."

            Be Dynamic by Tiana Horn
            <br>
            One day somebody asked me
            Who and what is NPHC?
            Is it just a parade of colors?
            How do they serve? How do they lead?
            Well to answer that question
            Just look to history
            We are the talented tenth
            from George Washington Carver to Dr. King
            We are A. Philip Randolph’s march
            And Dr. Kings speech
            We are Langston Hughes words
            And Wilt Chamberlain’s reach
            We are a legacy of service
            And a standard of excellence
            We are Zora Neale Hurston’s wisdom
            And we are Rosa Parks stance
            We are breaking down barriers
            Through unanimity of thought and action
            We wear our black and white
            Each in a different fashion
            We’re shades of black and blue
            We’re gold and we’re green
            We’re pure white and we’re purple
            We’re crimson and we’re cream
            We all bond together
            For greater service to the community
            We’re the definition of sisterhood and brotherhood
            We’re the epitome of unity
            So in case you were wondering
            Just who and what we are
            In case you couldn’t see past
            The yardshows, signs, and calls
            In case you were thinking
            We were just ordinary Greeks
            There is nothing ordinary about us
            We are the Dynamic Duke NPHC
